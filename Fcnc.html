            <p>
            For the final build project for the glockensprial, I used measurements from the old case to build a new frame, with a hole in between where all the keys are placed.<br> 
            </p>

                Using CNC software

                Used a ball tipped 3mm diameter drill cutter to predrill holes to screw the plates on.<br>
                Allignment of the plates were a little off as measurements were slightly off by me.<br>

                The larger plates experienced the largest deviation of the holes.

                CNC cutting, But there was a lot of dust as the dust collector was not placed at the correct height.<br>

                <img src="png cnc/IMG_6991.jpg" width="45%"><br>
                Finished cutting, then the edges were sand down and cleaned.<br>
                <img src="png cnc/New folder/IMG_7026.png" width="45%"><br>
                Due to a irregular depth cut in the pocketing face, which did not coincide with the layering of the plywood, thus some wood on certain portion of the piece were stripped.<br>

                To remedy this, I had used wood putty to fill out the slots in the frame.<br>
