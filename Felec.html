                For the electronics of this project, I have opted to use the ATTINY88, with the ULN2003N Darlington pair to drive a solenoid, at 6VDC and 300mA per solenoid. An external 12V powersupply would pass current into the 5V voltage regulator to run power into the chip and the solenoids.<br>                
                
                I had found the footprint for the ATtiny 88 eagle in Snapeda, then importing it into my Eagles library to be used to start wiring.<br>

                This is also the same for the uln2003an chip.

                Initial board traces:<br>

                I had used auto route to generate the traces, but the traces were too close together and not milled out, with other imperfection issues, thus I had decided to make another board.<br>
                There is also a big hole in the board, which is caused by using the wrong program on Mods, with me using the 2d mill instead of the 2d mill PCB, which caused the Gcode cut to be through the board, which was too deep.

                After the first attempt, I rewired the whole board by hand on Eagle.<br>
                I had renumbered the output pins of the ULN2003N and the ATTINY88 pins to be aligned physically. This will ensure a cleaner flow of lines rather than the criss cross lines of the first board.<br>
                The board schmetics:<br>
